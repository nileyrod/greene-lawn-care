You are a senior web developer. Build a modern, responsive marketing website for a local lawn care company using ONLY HTML, CSS, and a little vanilla JavaScript (no React, no frameworks). Put everything in a single index.html file for now.

BUSINESS INFO
- Business name: Greene’s Lawn Care
- Location: Richmond, VA
- Service area: Richmond and nearby areas
- Phone: (540) 424-1690
- Email: cgreeneslawncare@gmail.com
- Short intro/brand text:
  "Providing punctual, quality, and affordable lawn care services for Richmond and surrounding areas."

GOALS FOR THE SITE
- Make it easy for visitors to:
  1) Immediately see what the business does and where it serves.
  2) Call or text for a free estimate.
  3) Submit an online quote request via a simple form.
  4) See photos of past work and social proof.

OVERALL STYLE
- Clean, professional, and friendly.
- Color palette: greens and whites with a dark gray for text. Use different shades of green for accents and buttons.
- Use a modern, easy-to-read Google font (e.g., "Poppins" or "Inter").
- Layout should look great on mobile first, then scale nicely up to desktop.
- Add subtle hover effects on buttons and cards (no crazy animations).

PAGE STRUCTURE (single-page site with navigation links that scroll to sections)

1. TOP NAV BAR
- Sticky navigation at the top.
- Left: Greene’s Lawn Care logo as text (stylized, e.g. "Greene’s Lawn Care" with a small leaf/grass icon made using CSS or an emoji 🌿).
- Right: navigation links that smooth-scroll to sections: "Home", "Services", "Gallery", "Reviews", "About", "Contact".
- On mobile, collapse to a simple hamburger menu.

2. HERO SECTION ("Home")
- Full-width section with:
  - Headline: “Punctual, Quality Lawn Care in Richmond, VA”
  - Subheadline: “Keeping your lawn crisp, clean, and worry-free for homeowners in Richmond and nearby areas.”
  - Primary CTA button: “Call Now for a Free Estimate” (clicking should trigger a tel: link to (540) 424-1690).
  - Secondary CTA button: “Request a Quote Online” that scrolls to the Contact form.
  - On the right (or as background on desktop): a large hero image placeholder of a freshly mowed lawn and driveway. Use a generic image URL or a gray box with “Project Photo Placeholder”.
- Include a small line under the buttons: “Serving Richmond, VA and surrounding areas.”

3. SERVICES SECTION
- Section title: “Lawn Care Services”
- Short intro text about reliable, affordable lawn care.
- Use a responsive grid of service cards. Each card should have:
  - Service name
  - Short 1–2 sentence description
- Include common lawn care services such as:
  - Lawn Mowing & Edging
  - Trimming & Pruning
  - Mulch Installation
  - Leaf Cleanup & Removal
  - Seasonal Yard Cleanups
  - Bush & Hedge Trimming
- Make the content easy to edit later (no hard-coded lorem ipsum).

4. GALLERY SECTION
- Section title: “Before & After Gallery”
- Text: “See the difference Greene’s Lawn Care makes.”
- Responsive grid of image placeholders representing completed jobs (use generic placeholder images or colored boxes with “Before” and “After” labels).
- On hover, slightly zoom the images.

5. REVIEWS SECTION
- Section title: “What Our Customers Say”
- Subtext referencing great reviews on Google.
- Create 3–4 testimonial cards with dummy names and short positive reviews (keep them realistic but generic so they can be replaced later).
- Under the cards, include a button: “View More Reviews on Google” with a placeholder link (e.g., href="#" so the owner can later paste their Google profile link).

6. ABOUT SECTION
- Section title: “Why Choose Greene’s Lawn Care?”
- Short paragraph about being locally owned, punctual, quality-focused, and affordable.
- Use a 2-column layout on desktop:
  - Left: text bullet points (e.g., “Locally owned in Richmond, VA”, “Punctual and professional service”, “Consistent, high-quality results”, “Flexible scheduling”).
  - Right: another image placeholder or simple illustration of a neat lawn.

7. CONTACT / QUOTE REQUEST SECTION
- Section title: “Get a Free Lawn Care Estimate”
- Show phone and email prominently:
  - Phone: click-to-call tel:(540)424-1690
  - Email: mailto:cgreeneslawncare@gmail.com
- Simple contact form with:
  - Name (required)
  - Phone (required)
  - Email (optional)
  - Address or neighborhood (optional)
  - Service requested (dropdown list using the services above)
  - Message box
  - Submit button: “Request My Free Quote”
- The form does NOT need real backend logic; just use JavaScript to:
  - Validate required fields.
  - On submit, prevent default behavior and show a “Thank you! We’ll be in touch shortly.” message below the form.

8. FOOTER
- Include:
  - Business name: “© [current year] Greene’s Lawn Care. All rights reserved.”
  - Location text: “Serving Richmond, VA and nearby areas.”
  - Phone and email again.
  - Icons or simple text links for:
    - “Find us on Facebook” (placeholder link)
    - “View us on Google” (placeholder link)

RESPONSIVENESS & ACCESSIBILITY
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Make sure text has good contrast with background.
- All buttons should be keyboard accessible and have :focus styles.
- Use smooth scrolling for in-page navigation anchor links.
- Layout should stack vertically on small screens with comfortable padding.

EXTRA POLISH
- Add a subtle box-shadow to cards (services, reviews, gallery items).
- Use a max-width container (e.g., 1100–1200px) to keep content centered and readable on large screens.
- Add a small “Back to top” button that appears in the bottom-right when the user scrolls down and smoothly scrolls to the top when clicked.

Deliverable: a complete, well-organized index.html file implementing this design and content, ready to be customized with real photos and review links.
